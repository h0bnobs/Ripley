This project involves the implementation of a tool to aid penetration tests. It performs preliminary security checks and automates the enumeration of selected targets, including tasks such as host discovery, port scanning, subdomain and directory fuzzing, DNS enumeration, as well as optional web server and operating system fingerprinting. It can be used on a single target or multiple concurrently, which optimises performance and reduces overall assessment time. It focuses solely on identifying potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations without attempting to exploit them, ensuring a non-intrusive assessment process. It supports a range of scanning techniques to uncover very common and accessible security weaknesses and is designed with efficiency and scalability in mind. It also allows users to extend the set of tests. When the tool is finished, it displays results that highlight potentially useful or interesting findings, streamlining the process of identifying key areas for further investigation.
