# Todo

## Big picture things:
- HTTP response editor for webapps
- Automatic fuzzing
- Basic reporting function for each target. PDF format. Colour and severity coded?
- Built in exploit module for metasploit
- Custom scripts/plugins
- Add verbose levels to cli version?
- Get all the tools needed beforehand?
- Some kind of information storage about the target. Suggestions based upon this information.
- AI suggestions
- Concurrency

## Lower level stuff:
- OS detection
- Detect whether it's a webapp test or infrastructure target
- For the robots file, sort it into allow and disallow and get AI to point out the most interesting parts. 
- Remove 'multiple_targets' from config.
- Make the 'view' button work in the previous_scans page.
- Maybe add a different page for multiple scan previous results. Maybe add a new table in the db for them as well because currently, the table is designed to work for single scans only.

## GUI todos:
- Drag and drop config files
- The option to save configs and reuse them
- Better way to select/inpput options to edit the config file
- Back button in the results page.
- Make it look nice.
